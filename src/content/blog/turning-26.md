Yesterday, I turned 26.

## What did the last year teach me?

1. The major highlight of the last year has been me leaving my job to work full time on Crework and trying to make a living out of my passion for teaching, building products and tbh, not being an employee.
2. I am not sure how much I have learnt but I have changed a lot in the way I make decisions. I now hire people and have to pay salaries so I feel responsible in taking decisions, thinking about the second order effect of them and basically how much ROI they would produce and how many months of salaries would we be able to pay because of one step.
    
    I am still learning though.
    
3. Yes, we are bootstrapping and no we are not raising funds. It’s not like we are against it, but we just don’t have the time, the energy and the market right now to go out and try to raise funds for something we know is not investable. But it’s a good business, once you figure a few things out.
    
    I am not sure if we have figured them out yet, but we are close.
    
4. Things don’t happen unless you do them. Obviously, but you don’t realise it. You always need to keep doing things, specially when you are the engine. As a part in the machinery, you take rest a few times thinking that everyone else will handle things. When you are the “everyone” that every other part is dependent on, you can’t stop.
5. Take therapy before your inability to process your emotions turns into your inability to act.
6. Friends are important, family is important, you are important. But at times, one of these is more important than the others. Decide wisely.

And a lot more which either I am not remembering or don’t want to write about.
