I turned 25 yesterday.

Someone I know once told me that I have this bad habit of not looking at things I have and focus more on the things that I lack. I think it’s not just me, it’s everyone.

“Look at the brighter side” is a common phrase because we have to remind people to do that. They are already looking into the dark.

I believe that I have worked hard to change this habit and look at things in a more optimistic way.

I have felt the difference. So, I think reflecting at life as an optimist is also important.

1. When I was 17, I was the topper of my school. After my 12th, I went to Delhi to study for this exam called JEE. Being in that class in that coaching centre made me realise how I am not special, I am just one of them, these children that come here with bags on their shoulders, NCERT books in those bags and some dreams that they don’t know why they have. Looking back at it, I think it was a good thing. It made me realise how big the world is and you are not special if you are doing what everyone else is doing. If you want to be special, you need to do special things.
2. When I was 19, I got into a relationship. Now when I look back at it, I don’t know why my girlfriend chose me. I was a mess. I might have been the most fucked up person that she knew, but she was fine with it. It’s been more than 5 years and I am super grateful that I met her. Not meeting her might have taken my life in a very different direction. I don’t know how that life would have been and honestly, I don’t want to know.
3. When I was 21, I got an internship. I was the last person to get an internship on campus in college. Why? Because I didn’t know anything duh. Still, 2 people took a bet on me and selected me for an internship. I gained nothing from that internship as such, but I met this guy who wanted to start something of his own. I talked to him and I could see how much this person wanted to do it. We talked about ideas and about businesses, it was addictive. I’m pretty sure that was the turning point of my career.
4. I was 22 when I walked out of a startup I had been building for the last 7 months. I had a mental breakdown which became a bigger thing and I just left everything at the table and walked away. I mean, the “startup” was valued nothing, but the time, work, hope and potential I left at that time, I still think about it. For a few days, it felt like the world is ending. Then, things became better and I started Crework. It wouldn’t have happened without those few days and for that, I am grateful.
5. I was 23 when I made the first revenue from Crework. It was not much, it was almost nothing, but it was everything to me. That amount meant that people trusted me and believed in Crework as much as I did. It was the first step we took in the direction of a “business” and it is still one of the best things that happened to me.

Just like these, things have been happening to me that have changed my life and pushed it in a better direction. I should have been grateful for them, but just like everyone else, I have been blind towards them.

Things like birthdays gives me the chance to look back at my life, be happy and be grateful about things I have done, people I have met and the lives I have touched.
